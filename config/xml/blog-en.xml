				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aspiring artists know that the first sign of having “made it” is getting noticed by an art gallery. It’s a medical student’s equivalent of receiving their coat or a lawyer passing the bar. Everything leading up to that point is about cultivating a unique design and wondering if this career choice was a sustainable one. However, getting into a gallery isn’t the only way to succeed. In today’s success story, we share how PrestaShop merchant Glennys created her successful career as an artist-turned-entrepreneur.<br />
<span id="more-20780"></span></p>
<p>Glennys has been developing her style and cultivating a unique approach to creating art since she began painting in the 1990s. Inspired by her surroundings, Glennys creates pieces that evoke fond memories of summer vacations and the abstract interpretations of the beauty she sees in nature. She presented complete portfolios of her art but was criticized for her unique, eclectic style.</p>
<p>It was an uphill battle that turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Galleries ask for a 50% commission on all sales, which would have forced Glennys to price her pieces much higher to allow her to make a living off of her art. Glennys soon realized that selling art through a gallery was not meant for everyone, especially her.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20784" alt="GlennysGallery3" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/GlennysGallery3.png" width="767" height="519" /></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://glennyscastro.gallery/index.php?id_product=161&amp;controller=product&amp;id_lang=1">Surf and Turf</a> &#8211; 40” X 60” Mixed Media on Canvas $2,160</strong></p>
<h2 style="color: #3f4d67">Becoming an Entrepreneur</h2>
<p>Without a gallery to display her work, Glennys had only herself to rely on for promotion. She networked at her children’s schools and sports practices, even at restaurants. By taking the initiative in her community, Glennys established a name for herself on her home island of Puerto Rico. Thanks to her new connections, she had the opportunity to design t-shirts and jewelry and collaborate on fashion projects. Glennys realized that she was a natural entrepreneur. It’s that realization that made her decide to display her art by herself, after all she was already doing all the promoting. She quickly found that it would be too expensive for her to maintain a traditional gallery, but what about a digital gallery?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20783" alt="GlennysGallery2" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/GlennysGallery2.png" width="800" height="250" /></p>
<h2 style="color: #3f4d67">Launching an online shop</h2>
<p>Glennys reached out to a friend who was already running an online shop powered by PrestaShop. “Her lack of technical abilities reassured me that I’ll be able to use the platform too,” jokes Glennys. “Once we decided on the platform, I worked with a local freelancer, Rey Castillo, to put together my website. He held my hand through the entire website set up, ensuring that all my questions (no matter how basic) were answered. His top recommended modules were: Google Analytics, PayPal USA and the visits and visitors dashboard. Once the basic shop was set up, it was easy to add products and improve the SEO by filling in the Meta information.”</p>
<h2 style="color: #3f4d67">Making the first sale</h2>
<p>After the digital gallery had launched, Glennys promoted the “show” through all her offline channels. She then turned to online marketing by starting her Facebook page, then launching a blog. An online blog let her express in words both her personal journey and the story of her art. Her honest posts helped her grow her audience both locally and internationally, online. More people from the community started getting to know Glennys and her art. Customers started popping by her studio to pick up art and Glennys paintings were finally finding homes. Her first online sale came through just three months after the website launched. She shares, “It was an amazing feeling to have the online gallery finally succeed not just as an online shop, but also as a gallery for local shoppers.”</p>
<h2 style="color: #3f4d67">Future Plans</h2>
<p>Although things have started falling into place, Glennys has not slowed down. She regularly adds to her inventory and develops new collections to keep her website fresh. She also posts regularly on her blog and social media to keep her customers engaged and updated on her latest projects.</p>
<p>When asked what the best part of launching an online shop was, Glennys shared: “Launching my online shop allows me to be my own boss, a salesperson, an entrepreneur, a teacher, a mom, a wife and, of course, the artist behind each and every piece in the gallery.” <a class="twitter-share-button" href="https://www.twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%u201CLaunching%20my%20online%20shop%20allows%20me%20to%20be%20my%20own%20boss%2C%20a%20salesperson%2C%20entrepreneur%2C%20teacher%2C%20%20mom..%22&amp;via=PrestaShop">Tweet_Button</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today we welcome back Leah Hamilton, from Terms Feed, for the first of a two-part series dedicated to customer privacy protection.</em></p>
<p>Protecting customer privacy in your PrestaShop store is paramount: without establishing key protections for your customers, you won’t be able to build customer trust, and without customer trust your business won’t grow. There are a number of simple ways that you can increase privacy measures and ensure that your PrestaShop store is safe and secure for your customers and visitors. Let’s get started!<br />
<span id="more-20739"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#50b0be">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to set up is a good privacy policy. But what makes a good privacy policy?</p>
<p>The primary factor that determines what goes into your privacy policy is what your local data protection laws require. Let’s take a look at two major jurisdictions, the US and the EU. </p>
<p><strong>The US has no overarching data privacy law. This may make it seem like it’s easy to comply with the law (because there is none!), but there are a few pitfalls to be aware of.</strong></p>
<p>The US has three main pieces of legislation that cover data protection and privacy in more discrete areas: HIPAA, COPPA, and OPPA. HIPAA is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act#Privacy_Rule" target="_blank">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</a>; COPPA is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act" target="_blank">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</a>; and OPPA is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Privacy_Protection_Act" target="_blank">California Online Privacy Protection Act</a>. OPPA is the most important piece of legislation to comply with in the US, unless your store specifically targets children (in which case you also need to comply with COPPA).</p>
<p>OPPA states that operators of commercial websites that collect the personal information of California residents must post a distinct and easy-to-find link to the website’s privacy policy. The policy must outline:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>the kind of information gathered by the website;</li>
<li>how the information may be shared with other parties;</li>
<li>the process the user can use to review and make changes to their stored information; and</li>
<li>the policy’s effective date and any changes made since.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember that OPPA applies to all California residents, so while you may not be based in California, if your customers are, then you will need to ensure that your store is compliant.</strong></p>
<p>Many websites will have a dedicated California Privacy Notice, while others will include a clause within their overarching Privacy Policy. Here’s an example of a California Privacy Notice within a Privacy Policy, from NVIDIA:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/nvidia-privacy-policy.png" alt="nvidia-privacy-policy" width="671" height="497" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20740" /></p>
<p><em>Image: NVIDIA Privacy Policy (<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/privacy_policy.html" target="_blank">http://www.nvidia.com/object/privacy_policy.html</a>)</em></p>
<p>The Privacy Notice above requests that users write in to view the information, but the Privacy Policy itself on NVIDIA’s website covers the kinds of information gathered by the website and how the information may be shared with other parties.</p>
<p><strong>Now let’s take a look at some of the EU laws.</strong></p>
<p>The law currently in place in the EU is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive" target="_blank">EU Data Protection Directive 1995</a>. This directive sets out a number of data collection principles. These principles are:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Customers must be notified when you collect their data;</li>
<li>Personal data should only be collected for specific (and lawful) purposes;</li>
<li>The data collected should be adequate and relevant for the purpose;</li>
<li>Personal data should be accurate and kept up to date;</li>
<li>Personal data should not be kept for longer than necessary;</li>
<li>Appropriate security measures should be put in place;</li>
<li>Personal data must not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory also ensures an adequate level of protection for that data.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a new data protection regulation is coming into force in the EU. This is called the <strong>EU Data Protection Regulation</strong>. This Regulation will cover the whole EU region, replacing the patchwork of rules that exists in each individual country. The purpose is to make things easier for businesses to operate in the EU region without having to understand and comply with different sets of local laws.</p>
<p>This regulation will have much broader reach than just the EU &#8211; it will apply to anyone who deals with the private data of EU citizens. This means that US-based PrestaShop stores with EU customers may still need to comply with this regulation. The finer details of the regulation are still being worked out, but if you think this may apply to you it’s definitely something to look into further so that you can ensure you are compliant. </p>
<p><strong>In the meantime, if you are based in the EU, ensure that your store complies with the data protection principles set out above.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Still living with your parents? It’s time to pack up and apply to the Integration Fund!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/prestashop-launches-1000000-integration-fund-community/">launch</a> of the <strong>$1 million Integration Fund</strong> marked the start of special efforts made on offering local modules to PrestaShop merchants on the Addons Marketplace.</p>

<p>This is great news, and we are expecting <strong>a lot of additional local modules</strong> to offer a full catalogue to our merchants on PrestaShop Addons.</p>
<p><span id="more-20760"></span></p>
<h2 style="color: #cc4357">Boost your imagination with these examples of modules selected by the Integration Fund</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20763" alt="EN-Ex" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/EN-Ex-1024x517.png" width="700" height="353" /></p>

<h4 style="color: #79c6e4">1. Focus on the relevant countries</h4>

<h4 style="color: #79c6e4">2. Pick the right category</h4>
<p>If your module is relevant for a limited number of countries, that also means it concerns a local issue for merchants, which should be one of the following:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20762" alt="EN-Cat" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/EN-Cat.png" width="1024" height="313" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all get them &#8212; email newsletters. Whether you love the discounts they contain, or hate that they pile up like junk in your inbox, it’s safe to say that you’ve seen your fair share. Most people don’t give a second thought to how these emails are created, but as you start to draft your own email newsletters, you’ll find that there’s more to them than meets the eye. To help you launch your own awesome email marketing campaign, today we’re sharing some advice on how to craft marketing emails that convert.<br />
<span id="more-20731"></span> </p>
<h2 style="color:#319ea5">Newsletter Content</h2>
<p>Before you start writing anything, be it code or marketing content, the first step is to figure out what you want to say. Ask yourself, “What message do I want to convey to my customers?” Some examples include:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Shop our sale!</li>
<li>Check out today’s deals</li>
<li>Here are the new products for this season or holiday</li>
<li>New product launches</li>
<li>We’ll be at this appearance / event next</li>
<li>We have new partnerships</li>
<li>The latest industry news</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the message, it’s important to know what you’re trying to say before you do anything else. Once you know what you want to say, you can draft the email content. Be sure to use a voice that resonates with your <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-develop-buyer-personas-for-b2c-ecommerce-marketing/">buyer’s persona</a>, but keep it short so you don&#8217;t lose your customer’s interest. The exact length of your content will be determined by your email design, but more on that later.</p>
<h2 style="color:#319ea5">Call to action (CTA)</h2>
<p>After you know what you want to tell your customer, figure out what you want the customer to do next. For example, if you’re announcing your next event, do you want customers to buy tickets, RSVP or simply share the news? </p>
<p>Clearly identifying what you want your customers to do will make it easier for you to guide them there. Once you do so, you ‘ll need to identify the landing page that will allow customers to complete that action. Continuing with our previous example, if you want customers to RSVP for your event, provide the link where they can do so.</p>
<p>Finally, create a CTA button that drives users to the link. The CTA should contain enticing text that encourages the reader to click. <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/30-call-action-verbs-online-store/">Verbs are a great start; check out this article</a> for some examples.</p>
<h2 style="color:#319ea5">Email subject lines</h2>
<p>Once you’ve put together the message and know what you want your customers to do, it’s time to work on getting customers to open your email. The subject line is the most important line of text you’ll write for each email, and it is also the shortest. The goal of the subject line is to entice readers to open the email while accurately describing what’s inside.</p>
<p>Keep track of the subject lines you use and review them over time to ensure you’re optimizing your subject lines for conversions. </p>
<h2 style="color:#319ea5">Newsletter design</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, each email newsletter should have a great design. Create a basic template that you’ll use time and time again. The design should include your logo in the header and a footer at the bottom that has your contact info, social media buttons and most importantly, a link to unsubscribe from your emails. While you&#8217;re designing your template, remember that it should reflect not just this email’s message but your overall brand. This includes deciding on a color palette, and the types of headers and fonts you’ll use consistently.</p>
<p>The body of your email should contain the elements we’ve worked on already: the content and call to action button. It should also feature gorgeous product photos that appeal to the customer and make your email more clickable. You can choose to have just one message or supplement a main feature with other articles. If you choose to have more than 1 segment, make sure you highlight each with bold headlines.</p>
<p>For some examples from PrestaShop merchants, check out this article to see our <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/top-10-ecommerce-newsletters-of-2014-from-prestashop-merchants/">favorite newsletters from in 2014</a>.</p>
<h2 style="color:#319ea5">Mobile-Compatible</h2>
<p>Another key factor to consider are your mobile customers. Be sure your content can be scaled down to a smartphone’s screen size. Most of today’s <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/search?id_category=0&amp;search_query=newsletter" target="_blank">email marketing tools</a> have this functionality already built into the software. For a complete list of industry solutions available for your region please refer to our <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/en/industry-partners">partner pages</a>. </p>
<p>Use images that are sized properly to cut down on loading time. Also, be sure to give the images a descriptive name, just in case they don’t appear onscreen; otherwise your customers might wonder what 2356450x.jpg refers to&#8230; </p>
<h2 style="color:#319ea5">Next Steps</h2>
<p>For more ideas, check out what your competitors or suppliers have used in their emails.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a successful business owner, you’ll find that you never quite have enough time. Whether it’s making changes to your site, taking care of customers or just taking some time for yourself, there’s always more to be done. Today we’re helping you get back some of your time by showing you how to pack and ship more efficiently.<br />
<span id="more-20728"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#eba32b">1. Identify bottlenecks</h2>
<p>The first step to improving any process is identifying bottlenecks. A bottleneck in this context refers to any activity that operates at a slower rate than all other activities in your operation. These slow-downs are generally easy to identify in warehouses because of the accumulation of orders that occur around  that operation. Depending on the complexity of your business activity, you may not have any bottlenecks or many! </p>
<p>If you don’t see any bottlenecks right away, try spending a few days observing how orders are processed. You’ll be able to spot any inconsistencies in the process that could use improving. If after a few days, you’re still unable to identify a specific bottleneck, consider ways to improve your entire operation instead. </p>
<h2 style="color:#eba32b">2. Refine the process</h2>
<p>If you have multiple bottlenecks, prioritize them from major to minor issues. You can choose to prioritize them by cost spent or time wasted. Organize it in the way that makes the most sense for your business. We’ll tackle the large issues first, because resolving larger issues may also clear up the smaller ones.</p>
<p>Find ways to remove the first bottleneck by improving the time it takes to complete the associated action or limiting the number of errors created. Ask yourself: </p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>What part of this step isn’t necessary? What can I remove?</li>
<li>Can part of this step be completed later in the process?</li>
<li>Can part of this step be completed earlier in the process?</li>
<li>Can part of this step be combined with another task?</li>
<li>Is there a faster way to execute this task? </li>
<li>What additional resources can expedite this process?</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep this basic warehouse process in mind as we run through a couple of examples of how you can improve your business processes. </p>
<p><em>(1) Print packing lists → (2) pick orders → (3) print orders → (4) pack orders → (5) weigh package → (6) print shipping label → (7) off to the mailman</em></p>
<h4 style="color:#eba32b">Removing a step</h4>
<p>If you’ve been with the company for a long time, this is generally the hardest solution to find. All tasks, even those that seem obvious to you, must be evaluated. For a new perspective, consider having a new trainee make these suggestions. </p>
<p>In the example listed above, consider the 1st task, print packing lists. If packing lists are not needed for your company, you can simply print orders forms and pack customer orders using that document. This cuts down on both the time and resources spent on printing the packing list. </p>
<h4 style="color:#eba32b">Moving parts of a step</h4>
<p>There are some parts of your process that can be grouped with other tasks to maximize efficiency. Consider any action that takes away from the seamlessness of a process. For example, when  a product runs out while you’re packing orders, do you have to go and pull more inventory from storage? This is fine when you don’t run out of inventory, but if you run out of inventory multiple times during the day, it disrupts the flow of the process. Each time something runs out, the pack order process is paused so the inventory can be restocked.  </p>
<p>To make the order packing process more seamless, you create an inventory restocking process and move it the to the beginning of the day. It appears to add a new step to your overall process, but you’re simply defining a substep that is done regardless. By doing so, you clarify the overall process and make the order picking step more efficient. </p>
<h4 style="color:#eba32b">Refining a step</h4>
<p>Sometimes it’s about improving upon a process that you already have in place. Sometimes you need to take a step back to see how you can make your process better. In our example, look at the “weigh package” step. If you already have the products on hand, you can weigh the product in advance and enter them in your PrestaShop store so that labels are automatically generated with the corresponding weights. This may not completely eliminate the “weigh package” step because you’re still weighing each product, but your order packing process is now more efficient. </p>
<h4 style="color:#eba32b">Additional resources</h4>
<p>Your last resort improvement is to call upon additional resources. This option should be considered last because it is not only more expensive to implement, but it’s bit like cutting corners to improve your shop’s efficiency. However, once you’ve exhausted all your options, it can be the only improvement left to make. If you find that all the steps are running as efficiently as they can, yet you’re still not able to fulfill orders on time, consider hiring another employee to help with the overall shipping process. Additionally, you can acquire new tools to expedite specific tasks. This can be anything from purchasing better printers to expedite the printing to or new carts to expedite order picking. </p>
<h2 style="color:#eba32b">3. Measure</h2>
<p>Once you know what you want to improve in your shop and how you want to approach the task, it’s time to implement. However, to know how well the changes are or are not working, you have to put some type of measurement tool in place. For example, you can measure the amount of time each step takes to complete. Additionally, you can count the number of orders processed each day. Either way, be sure you have something to compare your old process’s effectiveness against the new. </p>
<h2 style="color:#eba32b">In a nutshell</h2>
<p>Improving your shop’s operations is a continual process. There’s always new technology or ideas that can help you improve the way your shop works. All you need is a little time, some patience and a drive to want to be better. To make your business more effective: </p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Define your bottleneck, or problem</li>
<li>Refine that process and make it better</li>
<li>Measure your changes</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a million things to think about when you start a new online shop. You&#8217;ll probably spend a lot of time thinking about design, how your products or services are presented and how to attract traffic to your website. Additionally, you’ll be thinking about how to achieve a high conversion rate for your customers to check out or to register. You may also find it a challenge to select the right mix of payment options to offer to your customers – and your selection should take your customers&#8217; needs and the costs and level of security of each payment method into consideration.<br />
<span id="more-20640"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#ea5c2a">Various options for various requirements</h2>
<p>Studies show that around 88 percent of all potential buyers leave an online shop if the only payment option offered is advance payment. By integrating further payment methods, the purchase abandonment rate can be reduced to 1%. Successful online merchants predict that in the next five years PayPal, credit card (with and without 3-D Secure protection), and &#8220;payment through invoice&#8221; will gain further customer importance (ibi research, 2015, University of Regensburg). </p>
<p>Apart from customer acceptance, merchants also need to compare the direct costs of a payment method as well as potential indirect costs. For instance, the University of Regensburg found out that for &#8220;purchase on account&#8221; other costs increased the direct costs such as those from late payments, payment irregularities, defaults, and even encashment procedures. </p>
<p>Last but not least, security plays an important role in the payment method selection process: on the one hand merchants want to establish customer trust by protecting sensitive payment data (e.g. thanks to encryption), and on the other protect themselves by applying fraud prevention measures for each payment method.  </p>
<h2 style="color:#ea5c2a">Support from experienced Payment Service Providers</h2>
<p>Online businesses should spend their IT resources on their own products rather than dealing with online security requirements. They can rely on payment service providers who offer different options for accepting different payment methods. Startups, and small and medium-sized businesses can benefit from the know-how of payment service providers. To serve merchants with maximum security, providers should be PCI-certified (Payment Card Industry). </p>
<p>Because online shops are at risk of fraudulent behaviour, payment service providers usually apply additional fraud prevention measures. Automated risk checks and encryption of sensitive payment information help ensure online shops do not fall victim to fraudulent abuse, and reduce financial damages. </p>
<h2 style="color:#ea5c2a">About PAYMILL</h2>
<p>PAYMILL is a PCI-certified payment service provider which makes it easier for online businesses to process credit card payments. The <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/en/industry-partners/payment/paymill">free PAYMILL module</a> offers an easy way for integrating card payments into your PrestaShop. PrestaShop merchants receive the access data for the module by registering and activating a free PAYMILL account. Merchants benefit from a flexible technical solution which allows designing their own payment and which offers the optional usage of the 3-D secure protection feature (known as Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode). All these features help merchants increasing their conversion rates. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Merchants that collect a lot of customer feedback and take the time to analyze it have most likely noticed that they often receive the same types of feedback over and over. </p>
<p>In this article, discover 5 customer types and how to best respond to their feedback to put your best face forward and boost your business.<br />
<span id="more-20655"></span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/09/Challenging.jpg" alt="Challenging" width="487" height="339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20692" /></p>
<p><strong style="text-decoration:underline">Suggestion:</strong> Respond and thank the customer for their feedback, inviting them to contact the online retailer by email, and resend the email address. </p>
<p><strong>If you offer the customer a discount, it’s better to not do so publicly</strong> to avoid other customers from demanding the same. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/09/Fan.jpg" alt="Fan" width="487" height="339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20690" /></p>
<p><strong style="text-decoration:underline">Suggestion:</strong> it is important to <strong>make fans feel good</strong> by sincerely thanking them for their feedback with personalized messages.</p>
<p>As proof of the quality of their services, e-retailers can display this feedback on their online store.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/09/Disappointed.jpg" alt="Disappointed" width="487" height="339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20689" /></p>
<p><strong style="text-decoration:underline">Suggestion:</strong> <strong>do not ignore this type of feedback</strong>. Instead, thank the customer for doing business with your store and apologize for any disappointment or inconvenience. This will show that you have quality customer service. </p>
<p>For example, the problem might have been the delivery service, if the package did not arrive on time. But for the customer, your online store is responsible and its reputation is therefore at stake. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/09/Busy.jpg" alt="Busy" width="487" height="339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20691" /></p>
<p><strong style="text-decoration:underline">Suggestion:</strong> even if their feedback is short, the number of stars they gave impacts the e-merchant’s rating. <strong>Therefore, this type of feedback is very valuable</strong>. </p>
<p>Here, the e-retailer can show their appreciation for the time the busy customer spent writing a recommendation, without taking up more of their time. The e-retailer can respond, “Thanks! Have a great day!“</p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/09/constructive.jpg" alt="constructive" width="484" height="627" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20688" /></p>
<p><strong style="text-decoration:underline">Suggestion:</strong> it is recommended to pay very close attention to the constructive customer’s feedback. <strong>Their suggestions for improvement are worth their weight in gold for online stores.</strong> Their feedback must be taken very seriously and online stores must improve the aspects mentioned. </p>
<p>Added bonus: <strong>Respond to their feedback by saying that their suggestion was used and invite them to go back to the e-store</strong>. <span style="font-style:italic">“Thank you for your feedback. We have now made it possible for the delivery address to be different from the billing address. We would love to welcome you back to our store! “</span></p>
<h4 style="color:#f89f45">About Trusted Shops</h4>
<p>The Trusted Shops solution helps retailers increase their sales figures by resolving their problems about trust in e-commerce. Trustbadge technology automatically collects real customer feedback, displays it in a personalized way on the website and increases their ranking in paid and free Google search results. Managing feedback conforms to NF Service procedures (AFNOR standard). The best retailers can obtain a trust mark from the European leader in e-commerce.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best features we added to PrestaShop v1.6 is the analytics dashboard. Not only is it one of the most appealing pages, it’s one of the most helpful when it comes to growing your business. Today we’ll break down the stats and share a few tips on how you can get the most out of them. Let’s get started!<br />
<span id="more-20653"></span></p>
<p>The first stats are often referred to collectively as KPI’s, or key performance indicators. Most companies use one or several of these statistics to evaluate their store’s overall performance compared to industry standards or past store performance.</p>
<h2 style="color: #86acc0">Dashboard</h2>
<p>The first chart you’ll see when you open your shop is your dashboard. Below we explain how each stat is calculated, what it tells you about your shop, and how the number can be skewed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20664" alt="Bo" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/09/Bo.gif" width="972" height="497" /></p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><strong>Sales</strong> <span style="font-style: italic">(Sum of all order totals)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This number is pretty straightforward &#8211; it shows you how much money your shop is making. Hopefully, you’ll see an upward trend: in other words, your shop is making more money this month then it did the previous month. An upward trend shows your shop is growing and converting more customers, while a downward trend shows that customers are not purchasing as much or as often.</p>
<p>However, merchants generally see increases and decreases from month to month. The holiday sales season is a perfect example: strong holiday sales are often followed by a high number of returns.</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><strong>Orders</strong> <span style="font-style: italic">(Number of orders received)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to know the number of orders that your store receives, because it indicates the number of customers you are successfully converting. Ideally, you’d like to see an upward trend here, too. However, don’t be surprised if you find that this number dips during slower months. You can easily compare each month’s performance against numbers from the previous year to continually evaluate your store’s growth.</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><strong>Cart Value</strong> <span style="font-style: italic">(Sales / Orders)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Average cart value indicates the average amount that a customer spends on each visit to your site. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Cross-selling and upselling features have proven to effectively increase this number</span>. However, being too focused on increasing cart value can also hurt your shop. Be sure you’re promoting not just larger orders, but more orders. An increasing number of orders of increasing value is your ultimate goal.</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><strong>Visits</strong> <span style="font-style: italic">(Sum of all traffic to your website)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Visits are a number game: the more people browsing your shop, the more likely you are to make a sale. Even when you don’t close a sale, your chances of converting that visitor one way or another, increase. <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-designing-lead-magnets/">Well-designed lead magnets</a> are a great way to engage your customers, even before they make the decision to purchase. However, a large number of visits can be attributed to “bots” scanning your website. The overstated number of visits can decrease other stats like conversion rates.</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><strong>Conversion Rate</strong> <span style="font-style: italic">(Sum of orders / sum of visitors)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Conversion rates give online merchants a good sense of how many visitors actually complete purchases. This metric is especially useful for merchants who are trying to optimize their website design. During A/B tests, conversion rates help merchants decide which final design should be used.</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin</strong> <span style="font-style: italic">(Sum of all revenue &#8211; sum of all expenses)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This statistic is one of the most important numbers online merchants should analyze. It clearly shows how much money your business has gained or lost. By filling in fields like wholesale price, bank charges and shipping fees, PrestaShop gives you an up-to-date estimation of your business’s financial standing.</p>
<h2 style="color: #86acc0">Products and Sales</h2>
<p>At the bottom of your dashboard page, you’ll find the product and sales table. It’s a quick summary of the information provided on your stats tab. We’ll detail what information each of the following tabs provides and how you can leverage that information.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20665" alt="product_sales" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/09/product_sales.gif" width="835" height="437" /></p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><strong>Recent Orders</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This tab shows you the most recent orders placed on your website. It also details who made the purchase, the order size, and even the number of items purchased in the order. You’ll have a good idea of how busy or not busy, the business is. When you’re managing a team, it’ll help you decide how you should organize the staff and their responsibilities.</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><strong>Best Sellers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This tab simply shows you which products have been selling the best over the specified period of time. It’s worth noting if a specific image color or product category gets the most sales. Consider staging your images to mirror your best sellers or even purchasing more products that fall within the most-popular category.</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><strong>Most Viewed</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This section simply lists the products that have been viewed the most by customers. Make sure you configure your back office to present the right numbers. Once you know which product is the most popular, match it against your best sellers list. Ideally the products should be similar. After all customers are more likely to purchase a product they’ve seen than one that they have not. If items on your most viewed list did not make the best seller list, consider adjusting the price to get customers to convert. Also keep in mind that a product’s merchandising may also play a role in how it’s viewed. For example, is the product currently listed on the homepage?</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><strong>Top Searches</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This table lists the top searches from customers browsing your website. It’s key to understanding what your customers are looking for when they visit your website. First, try searching each of these terms yourself to ensure they produce accurate results. If the search terms aren’t necessarily what you’re used to, consider adding them as “tag” to help customers find the product.
